Tourist Accommodation Prediction Neural Network
Tourist Accommodation Prediction Neural Network
Overview
This Python script demonstrates how to build and train a neural network to predict tourist accommodation choices based on given features. The model is designed to predict the type of accommodation a tourist is likely to choose, given a set of input features.

Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
scikit-learn
pandas
You can install these dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow scikit-learn pandas
Usage
Data Preparation:

Replace 'your_dataset.csv' with the path to your dataset. Ensure that the dataset contains relevant features and a target variable named 'accommodation_choice'.
Data Preprocessing:

The code includes basic data preprocessing steps, such as encoding categorical labels and standardizing features. Ensure that your dataset is suitable for these preprocessing steps.
Model Architecture:

The neural network model used in this code is a basic feedforward model. You may need to adjust the model architecture in the model.add(...) lines in the script based on the nature of your data and problem.
Training:

To train the model, run the script. It will train the model for a specified number of epochs with a batch size. You can adjust these parameters to optimize performance.
Evaluation:

The code will evaluate the model's performance on the test set and display the test loss and accuracy.
Making Predictions:

To make predictions for new data, replace 'new_data' with the data you want to predict. Ensure that the new data is preprocessed in the same way as the training data.
Customization
You can customize the model architecture, hyperparameters, and preprocessing steps to better suit your dataset and prediction requirements.
Important Notes
Ensure your dataset is properly formatted and contains the required features and target variable.
Consider data preprocessing steps like handling missing values and outliers as needed.
Experiment with different model architectures and hyperparameters to improve prediction accuracy.
Monitor the model's performance and retrain it periodically with fresh data to keep it up-to-date in a production environment.
